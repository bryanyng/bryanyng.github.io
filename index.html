        <h1>Hi, I'm Bryan</h1>
        <p class="intro">
            I am currently a final year Computer Science student studying at University of New South Wales (UNSW).
            Looking to gain experience in software development and to expand my skill-set.
            I am passionate in
            front-end and app development but also open to learning other areas of software development.
            I love to complain about UI designs that I come across in life. I also enjoy occasional sessions
            of photography.

        <h1>Experience</h1>
        <h2>Internship at Lalamove HK</h2>
        <h3 class="date">Nov 2016 - Feb 2017</h3>
        <p>
            Lalamove is an on-demand logistics company originating from Hong Kong. They currently have both a mobile
            and web app, which serve as gateways to utilizing their services. During my internship at their
            headquarters office in Hong Kong, I have gained many valuable experiences. Not only did it allow me to
            cultivate my programming skills, but also my interpersonal skills.
        </p>
        <p>
            The internship consisted of a main goal. Which is to develop the ‘Proof of Delivery’ feature for the
            existing app. The idea is that the user who called for their services are able to confirm that their
            package has been delivered, via receiving their signature on the app.
            Despite lacking experience in mobile and web development, I was very fortunate to have professional
            support from the other teams present at the office. Over the course of the internship we were encouraged
            to do a lot of the learning ourselves with the materials provided, and seeking the relevant team members
            for help when necessary. Which allowed me to develop good interpersonal skills and build tight connections
            in the office.
        </p>
        <p>
            To reach this goal, we followed the scrum process by conducting daily stand-ups, sprint planning, and
            sprint reviews. Jira (from Atlassian) was introduced to us as the tool to use to manage our project, where
            the project was broken down into user stories for us to complete. It was also necessary for us to follow
            the company’s practices in version control. For example, it was required of us to follow their guidelines
            on writing commit messages in Git. The guidelines provided a way of identifying what kind of update was made
            on a particular repository at a glance. Such as “FIX: …” meaning a fix was made, and “UPT: …” meaning an update.
            This gave me realistic experience in project management with Jira and Git where we actively collaborated on
            the project between us as interns.
        </p>
        <p>
            Unfortunately, I am unable to share any of my work done at Lalamove. But I would like to once again thank them
            for allowing an opportunity for me to gain valuable experience, and broadening my technological knowledge
            during my time there.

        <h1>My Work</h1>
        <h2>University Group Projects</h2>
        <p>
            As part of coursework, occasionally it was required of us to complete group projects together.
            Throughout these projects we are encouraged to utilise some form of version control and agile
            methods to manage our projects. Though these examples are not perfect, but they are examples
            that I think turned out particularly well.

        <h3>Android App - Recipedia</h3>
        <p>
            For this project, we managed to implement an app made for people who want to share and browse
            recipes for food. The final product was able make corresponding api calls to Google's Firebase,
            where we stored user information and recipe data. As seen in the screenshots below, users are able
            to register and login to their own accounts. And even if they are not logged in, users may still
            search and browse for recipes of their liking. While logged in, users are able to save recipes
            that they like and upload to share recipes of their own.

        <h3>Java Game - Sokoban</h3>
        <p>
            Under the restrictions of creating a 'Sokoban' game, and this being a Object-Oriented course
            taught with Java. We recreated the game using OO programming principles. Upon that we added
            multi-player and the ability for players to generate their own sokoban puzzles.
